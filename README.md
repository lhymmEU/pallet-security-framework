# pallet-security
A collection of tools designed specifically for Polkadot pallets.

## Framework Overview
This framework represents the foundational layer of a robust security analysis framework engineered specifically for Polkadot pallet verification. The framework implements a bifurcated testing strategy: conducting analysis at the individual pallet level, followed by runtime security verification. This methodology is predicated on the understanding that threat models exhibit high context specificity. Rather than attempting to construct a universal threat model, the framework emphasizes adaptability through modular threat model generation.

## Security Analysis Architecture

### Pallet-Level Verification
- **Primary Mechanism**: Formal model checking for invariant verification
- **Secondary Layer**: Targeted fuzzing strategies for edge case detection
- **Core Focus**: Derivation of mathematical correctness proofs

### Runtime-Level Verification
- **Primary Mechanism**: State machine fuzzing for interaction analysis
- **Secondary Layer**: Bounded model checking on critical execution paths
- **Core Focus**: Integration validation and cross-pallet interaction verification

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Asset Discovery
Automated identification and classification of security-critical assets within pallet implementations.

### Phase 2: Threat Oracle Definition
Development of pallet-specific threat oracles utilizing natural language processing, incorporating severity quantification metrics.

### Phase 3: Formal Verification
Generation of mathematical correctness proofs based on identified threat vectors.

### Phase 4: Dynamic Analysis
Implementation of customized test harness for targeted fuzzing of high-severity assets.
